Assignment linAlg1:

Write a small program containing 3 functions to do the following:

a. Multiply a 3 x 3 matrix by a 3 x 1 vector, the result will be a 3 x 1 vector.
b. Multiply a 3 x 3 matrix by another 3 x 3 matrix, the result will be a 3 x 3 matrix.

N.B. The order of the indices is : row x column (so differs from x, y coords)
It is alright to combine a. and b., writing one function that multiplies
a matrix of dimensions a x b by a matrix of dimensions b x c,
yielding a matrix of dimensions a x c.

c. Invert a 3 x 3 matrix using Gauss-Jordan elimination (sweeping)

Check your inversion function by using the result of a.:
	If A x = b then x = A_inverse b
or use the result of b. for a check, (unit matrix denoted by I)
	A A_inverse = I
	
Coding style: Don't hang your code in the view tree (event handlers, onClick etc.)
If you use a GUI, keep your domain classes (Matrix, Vector) and
your GUI classes separated,communicating via member calls.
You're not required to uses object orientation for this assignment.
Functions and arrays will do.
