In this assigment you will make use of transformations without using OpenGL.

Part 1.
Make a console application that can draw lines consisting of characters.
The way to do this is to fill an 2-dimensional char array (say A) with blanks.
Plotting a point at location x, y happens by the assignment A [yMax-y-1,x] = "*".

Part 2.
Once your program is able to plot arbitrary points in the array (test this!),
program an algorithm that uses the point plot function to draw lines.
It doesn't have to be Bresenham, efficiency is not so important here.
But your lines must have no gaps in them, and it must be possible for lines to run
in all directions, including horizontal and vertical (test this!).

Part 3.
Extend your program so that it can draw a cube and project it on the x-y plane.
The projection is allowed to be simple and non-perspective.
Leaving out the z coordinate will do, but perspective projection is also ok.
Test this part of your program before continuing.

Part 4.
Extend your program to be able to rotate the cube around the z-axis, by the use of
a transformation matrix. Test this and add a 3 screendumps to your sourcecode
with different rotation angles.
