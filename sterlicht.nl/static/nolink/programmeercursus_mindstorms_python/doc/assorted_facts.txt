*** The first line (shebang line) of the main program file should be:

#!/usr/bin/python3

(So not '#!/usr/bin/dev python3' as posed in the docs)


*** Unix line ends should be used

In Notepad++ from the menu pick [Edit][EOL Conversion][Unix/OSX Format]


*** After uploading to the EV3, the program files should be made executable (e.g. with FileZilla)

*** Only upload if the program is stopped
