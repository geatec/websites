			<h1>On-line consultancy</h1>

			<p>
			A few hours of consultancy by someone truly experienced in the field can ensure the success of you project and considerably shorted development time. And then there is the difference between a project result just barely working and a robust, reliable, extensible design. While this will only become visible at the next upgrade of your software, the difference is usually very significant in terms of costs.
			
			<p>
			On-line consultancy makes it possible to offer my development skills to you world wide without any overhead.
			
			<ul>
				<hr>
				<li>Quite often all a project needs is looking at system requirements together for a few hours and determining the best solution direction.
				
				<li>Optionally, after that an architecture design is drawn up and refined in a number of round trips, 
				
				<li>Finalizing the design is followed by regular monitoring sessions to safeguard the quality of the result.
				
				<li>Since details matter when developing software, during the whole of the project I remain available for advice and co-development, to the statement level if needed.

			<p>
			The costs of on-line consultancy are 150 Euros ex. VAT per hour, half of which is paid in advance via PayPall and the other half before the next session. You'll receive a detailed invoice via email and, if you wish, a quotation in advance. (Also see <a href="conditions.html" target="content">conditions</a>.)
			
			<p>
			Remote cooperation will make use of suitable technical means, typically Skype with screen sharing for meetings, GitHub for co-authoring of documents and source code, and Travis for continuous integration, augmented by email, phone and Whatsapp. However I will adapt to any means of remote cooperation used in your company.
