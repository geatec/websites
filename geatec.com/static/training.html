			<h1>In-company training</h1>

			<p>
			The training program is characterised by specialisation and depth.
			You will not encounter any e-learning.
			Effective transfer of experiental knowledge is only established through interaction between teacher and training participant.
			The essence of this interaction is the experienced teacher seeing "where the participant is" and giving him (m/f) exactly the little boost that he needs.

			<p>
			Expensive? On the contrary.
			After all, the hourly rate of a group of participants is much higher than the rate of one teacher!
			A training bogged down by textbook examples, does not resonate.
			Only the link to the reality of your employees ensures that what is learnt, lingers.
			The establishment of that link is exactly what you can expect from these trainings.

			<p>
			The following training courses can be offered at your company:<br>
