				<h2>Whom is this fundamental class for</h2>
				 
				<p>You have some experience with programming, either through work or as a hobby. You have interest in building applications that range from simple desktop forms to real-time games and small simulations. You are slightly overwhelmed by the size and subtleties of a language such as C#, but you want to learn all its secrets: from basic flow of control to classes, inheritance, and the extensive standard library. Beyond the lectures you are also planning to build software on your own to reach a good level in manipulating the language.</p>

				<h2>What will you learn</h2>
				
				<p>After this class is done, you will be able to use the following language facilities at a professional level:
				<ul class="bulleted">
					<li>Use of variables and basic imperative constructs</li>
					<li>The definition of new data structures via struct and class</li>
					<li>Basic object orientation: encapsulation, fields, getters and setters, methods, constructors, and custom operators</li>
					<li>Polymorphism and subtyping: interfaces, implementation, inheritance, and virtual and abstract methods
					<li>Generic classes</li>
					<li>Some collection and form classes</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>What does the C# course look like</h2>
				
				<p>The C# course is followed in a group of maximum 10 people. The costs of a two hour lecture are €40,-. You will receive a receipt. The number of lectures depends on your previous level of knowledge. With some programming knowledge, it should take about 10 lectures to become proficient with the topics listed above.</p>
				 
				<p>To start the C# course, you will first make an assessment interview. After we decide we wish to work together, we will make a learning agreement.</p>
				 
				<p>Successfully completing the course means that you will have absorbed and become proficient with the topics listed above. This means that I will release a certificate and will be available to support your skills for job interviews or with your superiors.</p>

				<h2>Some practical things</h2>

				<p>Please bring a laptop with Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition or a superior version installed. As an alternative you might choose to use Xamarin Studio. Make sure that everything is installed and functions properly before the first lecture. Experience suggests that not doing so will result in a significant waste of time.</p>
				 
				<p>We will be learning how to program, "line by line". Please do not expect to learn how to use wizards or "click-and-generate" code. We will also make absolutely no use of code copied and pasted from the Internet.</p>
				 
				<p>The course location depends on the number of participants. We will aim towards always remaining within a distance of 5km from the center of Rotterdam.</p>

				<h2>In conclusion</h2>

				<p>C# is a mature, powerful programming language capable of achieving many things. The language possesses a clean design, is uniform, predictable, and in general much appreciated in professional circles. It is very recently become capable of reaching all major platforms via the Mono platform, and this capability is achieved with free and open source tools. There seems to be very few applications and business scenarios where C# would not rise to the challenge.</p>
				 
				<p>Moreover, learning C# can be an excellent stepping stone towards learning other modern languages such as Java, and with some effort even C and C++.</p>
				 
				<p>Given the popularity of the language, there is a large number of jobs requiring some knowledge of the language. Unfortunately, many applicants have issues with even basic aspects of the language and the underlying computational concepts. In this course, you will reach the point of actually starting in the professional practice of C# programming.</p>
