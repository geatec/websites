				<h2>Whom is this fundamental class for</h2>
				 
				<p>You already have some programming experience and you know that software development is much more than producing or scripting webpages. You want to develop larger back-end systems using the appropriate tools.</p>
				 
				<p>Python currently is the number one programming language taught at universities worldwide. This clear, well designed language is suitable for building extensive, maintainable applications.</p>
				
				<p>Since performance-sensitive libraries for Python are written in C++, execution speed of massive computations is many times higher than e.g. in Java and dozens to hundreds times higher than e.g. in JavaScript. Especially the combination of Python with the NumPy and SciPy libraries currently is the de-facto standard for fast computations with large amounts of data.</p>
								
				<p>If you want to learn to head straight for your target by means of systematic design techniques, using this object oriented language in combination with the right libraries, this fundamental class is for you.</p>

				<h2>What will you learn</h2>
				
				<p>After completion of this fundamental class you master use of the following language facilities on a professional level:
				<ul class="bulleted">
					<li>Systematic, hiërarchical use of modules</li>
					<li>Basic datatypes: float, int, bool, string
					<li>Flow control statements: for else, if elif else, while, try except finally</li>
					<li>Functions with fixed or flexible parameters and atomary or compound return values</li>
					<li>Lambda's and local functions
					<li>Standard datastructures: tuple, list, set, dict</li>
					<li>Classes with constructor, attributes and methods</li>
					<li>Single and multiple inheritance</li>
					<li>Dynamic typing and polymorphism</li>
					<li>Use of the most important standard libraries of Python</li>
					<li>Use of the NumPy high-performance computing library</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Some practical things</h2>
				
				<p>If you enter a learning agreement with me, we'll see each other regularly. Most things will happen in a small group, never more than 10 people. The costs of a 2 hour lesson are €40,-. You'll receive an invoice that you can present to your employer if required.</p>
				 
				<p>The location depends upon the size of the group. If the situation requires it, part of the coaching can also take place on-line, e.g. if you live in a remote location or if your availability is limited because you have a job</p>
				 
				<p>You'll enter into your teaching agreement directly with me, also in case your employer pays back your training to you after the fact. In that way anyone can take part in the training, also if you're not employed at the moment.</p>
				 
				<p>Before you start your training, we have an intake of half an hour. There are no costs in connection with this. Depending on the intake, we both have the freedom to enter a learning agreement or not. My conclusion about this I'll base upon your previous knowledge and experience, but also on your preparedness to learn something new. How you reach your conclusion is totally upto you. Probably you'll at least want to know if I can offer you something that will really help you along. Feel free to ask in depth questions. You'll invest time and money, so you have every right to know what you're embarking on.</p>
				 
				<p>Once you successfully completed a subject, you'll obtain a certificate for that subject and you can call on me in case you'll apply for a job, in order to convince your future employer of your skills. I'll gladly stay in touch with you and your career.</p>

				<h2>In conclusion</h2>
				
				<p>The past 15 years I've earned a living with the combination of Python and C++, a.o. building software for electro-cardiology, realtime process controls and finding oil and gas. For Python there's <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">a huge number of free libraries available</a> of good quality and for many types of applications. You'll find Python in single board control systems, medical image processing, web applications and in software for scientific and technical applications. In fact there's no application area that hasn't been penetrated by this language.</p>
 
				<p>Especially the combination of Python and C++ makes it possible to tackle almost any IT problem. As an example many webservers are written in Python, of which Django probably is best known. Besides that there are several solutions to use Python in the browser, including <a href="http://www.transcrypt.org">one that I wrote</a>. Many companies have discovered the power of Python and Python developers are in great demand. The language provides a good entry point into the IT, with almost limitless possibilities for growth. Because Python lends itself to both fast and concise development, the langage is very suitable for developing (multi platform) applications on a commercial basis.</p>
