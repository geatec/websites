				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<p>After obtaining a master degree in electronics and information theory at Delft University, I've been designing and building technical computer applications since 1987, via my own <a href="http://www.geatec.com">company</a>.</p>
				 
				<p>My first large project was the automation of 22 container cranes at the Maasvlakte near Rotterdam. After this a diversity of other projects followed, like building design software for train drive electonics, software for the oil and gas industry and, more recently, software for medical research, which resulted in a number of <a href="http://www.geatec.com/publications">scientific publications</a>. You'll find a complete overview in my <a href="http://www.geatec.com/jdeh_cv_english.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
				 
				<p>Besides that I am the intiator of a number of open source projects, of which the <a href="http://www.transcrypt.org">Transcrypt Python to JavasScript compiler</a> is the most recent example. In combination with my work I've always reserved about 20% of my time for educational activities. Usually this concerned in-company workshops on the subject of object oriented design. In recent years I am also a lecturer at the Hogeschool Rotterdam, where I teach C++, Python, Robotics, Real Time Analysis, Real Time Embedded Systems, Image Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Linear Algebra, Theoretical Informatics and Mathematical Logic.</p>
				 
				<p>During the projects that I worked on, often as lead designer, I've learned a lot. Most textbooks and training courses stop short of the real problems. Software is about managing complexity, devising a flexible architecture and making practical design decisions.</p>
				 
				<p>Apart from the technical aspects, making software is about clear communication with clients. Wether you are employed somewhere or have your own company, it is essential to on one hand fully involve the client into a project, but on the other resist the temptation to go along with requirements that may needlessly put the project at risk. Respect for the client and a personal vision, based upon experience and technical insight are both needed.</p>
				 
				<p>Besides the big picture making technical software is about details. Technical applications are 'unforgiving': something works or it doesn't, no smooth talk will change the bare facts. I'd like to put my experience about how to get on in this no-nonsense world at your disposal.</p>
				 
				<p>What I ask from you is an open, inquiring attitude and the preparedness to gain insight in all aspects of the development of technical applications. In the art of computer programming, understanding the technical details of a small piece of sourcecode can be just as important as insights on the architectural level.</p>

				<h2>Some practical things</h2>
				
				<p>If you enter a learning agreement with me, we'll see each other regularly. Most things will happen in a small group, never more than 10 people. You'll work in your own pace at your own level and are coached individually. The costs of a 2 hour sesson are €40,- for a fundamental class and €60,- for  masterclass. You'll receive an invoice that you can present to your employer if required.</p>
				 
				<p>The location depends upon the size of the group. If the situation requires it, part of the coaching can also take place on-line, e.g. if you live in a remote location or if your availability is limited because you have a job.</p>
				 
				<p>You'll enter into your teaching agreement directly with me, also in case your employer pays back your training to you after the fact. In that way anyone can take part in the training, also if you're not employed at the moment.</p>
				 
				<p>Before you start your training, we have an intake of half an hour. There are no costs in connection with this. Depending on the intake, we both have the freedom to enter a learning agreement or not. My conclusion about this I'll base upon your previous knowledge and experience, but also on your preparedness to learn something new. How you reach your conclusion is totally upto you. Probably you'll at least want to know if I can offer you something that will really help you along. Feel free to ask in depth questions. You'll invest time and money, so you have every right to know what you're embarking on.</p>
				 
				<p>Once you successfully completed a subject, you'll obtain a certificate for that subject and you can call on me in case you'll apply for a job, in order to convince your future employer of your skills. I'll gladly stay in touch with you and your career.</p>
